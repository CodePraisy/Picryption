## Welcome to the Picryption!

### Picryption 1.1.03 Update

Added a Major Security Buff, rendering all non brute force decrpytion methods void (That I know of) and adding a work factor to make brute force methods take longer to decrypt then atoms in the universe.

### Mission

Picryptions focus for existing is to make the spread of information safer and worry free from any unwanted eyes. (It was also mainly just a fun project for me lol)

### How to install

- click on the green "Code" button and then click "Download ZIP"
- right click the downloaded file and click "Extract"
- Once it's finished, go to the folder it just made and click the file called "Picryption"
- Then double click on it to open the file.
- It may take a while to load in depending on how good your system is, so don't worry if it takes a minute to load.
- If you want more help on how to use the file input "y" in the tutorial menu when it asks you whether you want a tutorial or not.

### Other information

*Make sure that you and the person receiving your encrypted message has the same versionn of Picryption or the decryption **will not work.*** 

Please note that this is the beta version and not the full Picryption so expect bugs. Feel free to report any bugs or such to me or in the "Discussions" Section on github!
