## Welcome to the Picryption!

### Picryption 1.1.05 Update

Fixed Yearly time bug.

### Mission

Picryptions focus for existing is to make the spread of information safer and worry free from any unwanted eyes. (It was also mainly just a fun project for me lol)

### How to install

- click on the green "Code" button and then click "Download ZIP"
- right click the downloaded file and click "Extract"
- Once it's finished, go to the folder it just made and click the file called "Picryption"
- Then double click on it to open the file.
- It may take a while to load in depending on how good your system is, so don't worry if it takes a minute to load.
- If you want more help on how to use the file input "y" in the tutorial menu when it asks you whether you want a tutorial or not.
